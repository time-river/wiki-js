# Assembly

The Symbols `($,%,*)`:

- `$` is a prefix is for immediates (constants)
- `%` prefix is for registers (they are required)
- `*` indicates an absolute jump, in contrast with the absense of the asterisk meaning a relative jump.
- `( ____ )` is used for dereferncing a memory location. Dereferncing is to, access the value at address `____`
